        <h3>Current Research</h3>

        </p>As an NIH T32 Postdoctral Fellow in Trauma and Sepsis, my work is focused on understanding the biological mechanisms underpinning poor prognoses for trauma and sepsis patients. In other words, who gets sickest the fastest follwing traumatic injury, and why? Moreover, how can we quickly identify these patients in order to streamline their care and decrease overall mortality?</p>

        </p>I am particularly interested in leveraging the high-quality prehospital data obtained by ground and helicopter Pittsburgh EMS agencies and the in-hospital data collected at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), and merging this with biomarker data analyzed in the Department of Surgery to identify novel biomarkers of trauma and sepsis. My work will involve secondary analyses of data from studies such as&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1802345" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">PAMPER</a><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;"> (Sperry et al., 2018, NEJM) and groups such as&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.litesnetwork.org/" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">LITES</a><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">.</p>

        </p>Pittsburgh is an ideal home for this postdoctoral work, as it integrates a number of outstanding EMS agencies, experts in pre- and in- hospital trauma and shock, and computational power at both the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. This work is based out of the Billiar Lab and is interdisciplinary in nature. As such, it fits within the newly formed Pittsburgh Trauma Research Center and it integrates investigators from the Department of Surgery and Department of Emergency Medicine.</p>        


        <h3>Academic and Professional Training</h3>

        </p>I received my PhD in Biogeochemistry from the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://web.mit.edu/" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">MIT</a><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.whoi.edu/" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">WHOI</a><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;"> Department of Marine Chemistry and Geochemistry. My thesis research focused on understanding novel stable isotope and phylogenetic signals diagnostic of microbial metabolisms over geologic time and in the modern environment. This work was supported by an NSF GRFP Fellowship.</p>

        </p>I was also part of the <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/">Harvard-MIT Health Sciences &amp; Technology</a> </span>Graduate Education in Medical Sciences Training Program.<span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp; I led a project between Harvard Brigham and Women's Hospital, MIT, the National Collegiate Emergency Medical Services Foundation, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to assess the mental health of college students and collegiate EMS providers.</p>


        <h3>More About Danielle</h3>

        </p>My interest in this work has been driven, in part, by witnessing and wanting to improve early interventions for severely injured patients as an urban and wilderness EMT for over 10 years. I am lucky to have worked for a number of EMS agencies including Penn State EMS, MIT EMS, and Foxwall EMS.</p>

        </p>As a member of the Explorer's Club, scientist, climber, and runner, I spend my free time adventuring in the outdoors.</p>
